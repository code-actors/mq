# PR #7 Summary â€“ Phase 3 Persistence & Recovery

## Overview
- Marks Phase 3 of the implementation plan as complete with 63 persistence-focused tests passing, increasing total coverage to 114/114.
- Delivers the persistence engine and recovery system described in the plan, enabling durable queue state with crash recovery.

## Key Changes
- Introduces a file-backed `IPersister` implementation that manages journal appends, atomic snapshot writes, replay, truncation, and snapshot trigger heuristics based on time and operation thresholds.
- Extends `QueueManager` with APIs to build `QueueSnapshot` payloads and invoke the persister for automatic snapshots and journal maintenance.
- Adds a `SnapshotSerializer` with CRC32-protected headers, JSON payloads, and lightweight validation helpers for version probing and integrity checks.
- Implements a `RecoveryService` that loads snapshots, replays journal operations, restores deduplication indexes, and requeues messages with expired leases.
- Expands `PersistenceOptions` so snapshot cadence can be tuned without code changes.

## Testing Highlights
- New unit suites validate `FilePersister` behaviors (journaling, snapshot storage, truncation) and `SnapshotSerializer` error handling across malformed headers and CRC mismatches.
- An integration suite exercises end-to-end crash recovery, confirming deduplication, lease restoration, and journal replay after simulated failures.

## Follow-up Considerations
- Journal replay currently skips replace operations; future work could incorporate full envelope payloads so deduplicated supersedes are restored without relying solely on snapshots.
- Dead-letter queue persistence is deferred to later phases and remains a placeholder within generated snapshots.
