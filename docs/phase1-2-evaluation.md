# Phase 1 & 2 Implementation Review

## Phase 1 – Foundations & Contracts

### What’s in place
- Core interfaces for queue manager, buffer, persistence, handlers, leasing, DLQ, and publishing are defined, and shared models/options exist as the contract layer. 【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/Interfaces/IQueueManager.cs†L1-L80】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/Models/MessageEnvelope.cs†L1-L55】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/Options/QueueOptions.cs†L1-L44】
- Serialization tests cover operation records, snapshots, and enum formatting to guard model round-trips. 【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/Serialization/SerializationTests.cs†L12-L96】

### Gaps vs. plan
- The plan calls for dependency-injection registrations and configuration binding skeletons, but there is no `IServiceCollection`-based extension or related tests in the source tree. 【F:docs/plan.md†L36-L49】【7d906a†L1-L2】
- Required contract validation tests for option defaults and DI registration smoke tests are absent; the existing Phase 1 tests focus solely on serialization helpers. 【F:docs/plan.md†L42-L49】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/Serialization/SerializationTests.cs†L12-L96】
- Integration smoke tests (minimal host wiring, serialization compatibility across persistence boundary) mentioned for Phase 1 are missing—the integration test project has no test files. 【F:docs/plan.md†L47-L49】【5aa6e1†L1-L3】
- Test infrastructure/mocking utilities described in the plan were not added; the test projects contain only direct MSTest usage without shared fixtures or helpers. 【F:docs/plan.md†L36-L44】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/CircularBufferTests.cs†L11-L214】

## Phase 2 – Core Components

### What’s working
- A circular buffer with CAS-based enqueue/checkout logic, deduplication index, and queue manager wiring exists, along with persistence serialization support. 【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/CircularBuffer.cs†L11-L340】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/DeduplicationIndex.cs†L8-L170】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/QueueManager.cs†L47-L349】【F:src/MessageQueue.Persistence/Serialization/JournalSerializer.cs†L11-L168】
- Unit tests exercise buffer CRUD paths, dedup index operations, and queue-manager happy paths. 【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/CircularBufferTests.cs†L14-L214】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/DeduplicationIndexTests.cs†L12-L139】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/QueueManagerTests.cs†L15-L204】

### Discrepancies
- The plan expects explicit slot metadata (head/tail tracking, version tokens, state-machine transitions) but the buffer currently stores envelopes directly and relies on array scans without maintaining per-slot state beyond `MessageStatus`, making CAS transitions partial and costly under contention. 【F:docs/plan.md†L64-L72】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/CircularBuffer.cs†L45-L167】
- Buffer deduplication only supersedes messages that are already `InFlight`; ready messages with the same key are left untouched, returning the old ID instead of replacing the payload, contradicting the design requirement that newer messages replace older ones. 【F:docs/design.md†L8-L24】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/CircularBuffer.cs†L180-L217】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/QueueManager.cs†L57-L108】
- QueueManager requeues and lease extensions search the entire buffer on each call, with TODO comments for DLQ hand-off and a hardcoded retry limit (`MaxRetries = 3`) instead of pulling handler-specific configuration, leaving planned option integration incomplete. 【F:docs/plan.md†L93-L99】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/QueueManager.cs†L201-L337】
- Deduplication index updates always succeed via `AddOrUpdate` without conflict detection, so the “optimistic concurrency” requirement is not met, and no tests cover supersede races. 【F:docs/plan.md†L74-L82】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core/DeduplicationIndex.cs†L63-L80】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/DeduplicationIndexTests.cs†L90-L139】
- Claimed multi-threaded stress and integration tests (50 concurrent producers, end-to-end dedup flow) are pared down to simple task loops inside unit tests; there are no dedicated stress or integration suites. 【F:docs/plan.md†L70-L104】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/CircularBufferTests.cs†L194-L214】【F:src/MessageQueue.Core.Tests/QueueManagerTests.cs†L15-L204】

## Recommended End-to-End Tests
1. **DI & configuration bootstrapping** – Start a `HostBuilder`, register queue services (once implemented), bind options from configuration, and assert that `IQueueManager`/`IPersistentQueueHost` resolve, fulfilling the Phase 1 smoke-test goals.
2. **Dedup replacement lifecycle** – Publish two messages with the same dedup key, ensure the second replaces the first while one handler has the original in-flight, then verify post-ACK state and journal persistence.
3. **Concurrent producer/consumer stress** – Run multiple producers and consumers over several seconds, asserting no lost or duplicated messages, lease renewals, and stable metrics.
4. **Persistence round-trip** – Enqueue messages, flush a journal snapshot via `IPersister`, simulate a restart, and ensure replay restores buffer state and dedup index.
5. **Retry to DLQ boundary** – Force handler failures to reach the retry limit, confirm requeue attempts increment metrics, and that DLQ hand-off (when implemented) captures envelopes with the recorded failure metadata.
